Facial verification using Siamese Network<br>
Description:<br>
This is a Facial Identification and Verification tasks. <br>
There is a gallery of individuals that a Siamese CNN network is trained on using LFW dataset. <br>
A Siamese network is a type of neural network with two identical subnetworks that are used to compare the similarity between two inputs. <br>
The subnetworks share weights and architecture, allowing the network to learn a feature representation that is invariant to small variations in the input data,<br>
making it useful for tasks such as image matching and face recognition.<br>
